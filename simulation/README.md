# AeroTwinOps Simulation

This is a basic simulation for the AeroTwinOps project using SimPy. It simulates a production line where machines produce parts, occasionally break down, and get repaired. Sensor data is generated and logged for each production event.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate into the project directory.

2. **Install dependencies** using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
